# FastSBL
A fast sparse Bayesian learning algorithm based on gaussian scale mixture model for regression problem

This code is for paper titled "An efficient sparse Bayesian learning algorithm Based on Gaussian scale mixtures", which is submitted to TNNLS. 

The images in dataset are acquired from http://sparselab.stanford.edu/ and http://decsai.ugr.es/cvg/dbimagenes/.

The function FastLaplace.m in tools corresponds to the fast SBL algorithm based on Laplace priors, which is acquired from the origianl authors at http://www.dbabacan.info/publications.html. The paper is titled "Bayesian Compressive Sensing using Laplace Priors". 

GGAMP-SBL.m corresponds to the algorithm 1 in paper titled "A GAMP based low complexity sparse bayesian learning algorithm".  

For comparison, sparseLab 2.1 and RVM V1.1 toolboxs are needed, which can be obtained from http://sparselab.stanford.edu/ and http://www.miketipping.com/downloads.htm, respectively. 

This code is implemented in Matlab 2019b. If have any questions, please contact zhouwei@hust.edu.cn
