# FastSBL
A fast sparse Bayesian learning algorithm based on gaussian scale mixture model for regression problem

This code is for paper titled "A fast sparse Bayesian learning algorithm using Gaussian scale mixtures". 

The images in dataset are acquired from http://sparselab.stanford.edu/ and http://decsai.ugr.es/cvg/dbimagenes/.

The function FastLaplace.m in tools is obtained from 

GGAMP-SBL corresponds to the algorithm 1 in paper "".  

For comparison, sparseLab 2.1 and RVM V1.1 toolboxs are needed, which can be obtained from http://sparselab.stanford.edu/ and http://www.miketipping.com/downloads.htm, respectively.
